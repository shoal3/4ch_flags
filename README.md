# Update the 4chan Flags!

The FAMFAMFAM flag icons 4chan uses were made in 2007 and contain many outdated and missing flags. Anons and staff have already updated/made SOME of the flags but these updates look bad. These new flags have been carefully remade so they perfectly match the original flag icon pack. It would be great if 4chan used these flags instead and completely replaced the current ones.

#### - Outdated -

The outdated flags on 4chan are: Afghanistan, Guadeloupe, Honduras, Iraq, Lesotho, Mauritania, Paraguay, Syria, Tokelau, and Tuvalu.

#### - Bad Flags -

The bad flags (made by anons and staff) are: Antarctica, Curaçao, Ecuador, Guernsey, Isle of Man, Jersey, Kosovo, Libya, Montenegro, Myanmar, Saint Martin, Sint Marteen, South Sudan, Western Sahara, Uzbekistan, Vatican City

#### - Missing Flags -

The missing flags on 4chan are: French Guiana, Carribean Netherlands, Réunion, Saint Barthélemy, Svalbard and Jan Mayen, and US Minor Outlying Islands.

#### - Flags that could be better -

These are flags that came with the original icon set but they could be fixed up. I recommend using these too

Bolivia, Gibraltar, Haiti, Morocco, UAE

#### - Flags that could be added -

/sp/ uses the flags of England, Scotland, and Wales but doesn't have Northern Ireland. Here's a flag that could be used on /sp/ for Northern Ireland: 

Bougainville isn't a country but it may become one in 2027. Here's the flag in case: 

**Another flag error: Timor-Leste (.flag-tl) is called "Unknown" on 4chan for some reason.**
