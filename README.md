# Update the 4chan Flags!

The FAMFAMFAM flag icons 4chan uses were made in 2007 and contain many outdated and missing flags. Anons and staff have already updated/made SOME of the flags but these updates look bad. These new flags have been carefully remade so they perfectly match the original flag icon pack. It would be great if 4chan used these flags instead and completely replaced the current ones.

### Outdated, Missing and Bad Flags

The outdated flags on 4chan are: Afghanistan, Guadeloupe, Honduras, Iraq, Lesotho, Mauritania, Paraguay, Syria, Tokelau, and Tuvalu.

The bad flags (made by anons and staff) are: Antarctica, Curaçao, Ecuador, Guernsey, Isle of Man, Jersey, Kosovo, Libya, Montenegro, Myanmar, Saint Martin, Sint Marteen, South Sudan, Western Sahara, Uzbekistan, Vatican City

The missing flags on 4chan (e.g. French Guiana just uses the French flag) are: French Guiana, Carribean Netherlands, Réunion, and Saint Barthélemy

### Flags that could be better

**Another flag error: Timor-Leste (.flag-tl) is called "Unknown" on 4chan for some reason.**
